    I'm an mechanical engineer with a Master Degree in Innovation and a MBA.
    The last 10 years I've been applying Design Thinking and Agil Methodologies to develop new services and processes.
    I'm currently learing new programing languages and development tools to improve my skill for fast prototyping and customer validation.
